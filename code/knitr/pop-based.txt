We can imagine hypothetical futures where wealth, educational attainment, population density, and geographical access change for patients with the same hypothetical demographics and symptoms. We are interested to see how utilization patterns look in these hypothetical futures. To do this, we first take our sampled population and using the estimated model coefficients, estimate the utilization probabilities of care seeking at different facilities for each survey respondent. Then, holding constant all attributes except the one of interest, we can modulate those attributes we wish to investigate in certain segments of the population and see how the overall utilization probabilities change at a population level. We call this a counterfactual analysis. For example, consider wealth: the sampled population is divided into 5 quantiles (quintiles) of wealth, as measured by how many assets the households own. We can test what will happen to the population average probabilities of utilization if all the people in the poorest quintile were as wealthy as those in the second poorest, and then if all those people were then as wealthy as those in third, and so on. The resulting probabilities represent how we might expect utilization patterns to change as the population becomes incrementally more wealthy, while also showing the isolated effect of wealth on utilization. Likewise, we can see how utilization changes as years of household educational attainment increase. According to our GBD forecasts, we expect educational attainment to increase from 8.6 years in 2010 to 11.5 years in 2030. Again, we can test the expected change in population-level utilization patterns would be given this type of increase in educational attainment. Finally, we will also look at the effect of living in an urban versus a rural area, as well as the affect of improved physical access to care (measured here as living less than an hour from the nearest health facility). We explore the results of these population-level counterfactual analyses in the following pages. \\\

Key Takeaways:

\begin{itemize}
\item Wealth increases total utilization, but only slightly.
\item As more people become wealthy, we see substitution of providers - away from public and toward the private, especially hospitals.
\end{itemize}

Key Takeaways:

\begin{itemize}
\item We see a small incremental increase in total utilization (2\%).
\item More education is associated with substitution of care away from public and toward private facilities, especially private hospitals.

Key Takeaways:

\begin{itemize}
\item Compared to rural households, urban households are less likely to visit a Public PHC and more likely to go to a public hospital, and slightly more likely to seek facility based care overall.
\item Physical access alone does not seem to affect utilization much from baseline, even though only about 80\% of households reported living within an hour of a health facility.
\end{itemize}
